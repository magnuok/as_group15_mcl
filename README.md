Autonomous Systems, Group 15. Monte-Carlo Localization

This project investigates real time estimation of a mobile robot's position and orientation (pose) by the Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm. The method has been implemented with Robot Operating System (ROS) tested on a mobile robot, equipped with a laser range finder. Five experiments were carried out to evaluate the implementation. The experiments gave satisfying results regarding the accuracy and robustness of the MCL implementation.
